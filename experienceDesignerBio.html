                        In my childhood, whenever my kid sister or I were having trouble with our school work, our grandmother would always tell us,
                        <em>&quot;Make it into a game! Find the pieces that interest you. Start playing with them. Before you know it, you&apos;re 
                        having fun finding out how they all fit together. But more importantly, you&apos;re learning!&quot;</em>

                        As a self titled Experience Designer and Developer, I&apos;ve chosen to see and do things with VR from a different 
                        perspective. Games, movies, concerts, a majestic view from atop a mountain peak, and even those stagnant moments of having 
                        to be at work are all different ways of experiencing our individual realities. Doesn&apos;t matter if those realities are 
                        of the virtual or the real-real, each come with varying forms of interaction. 
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <div class="bioTextPara">
                        This choice of seeing and doing is a personal belief system. As we know by looking all across nature, and as grandma still 
                        points out, games are so much more than a way of having fun. They can provide a positive means of installing an endless list 
                        of things we may need throughout our lives, and a way of honing the installed traits and skills as well as preexisting ones.
